Sample tests for cs315003f18 pa2 -- cycles with a diagonal
-------------------------

These tests are adjacency matrices for  graphs that are cycles with one diagonal.
Graphs are of sizes 10, 100, 1000, 10000 and 30000

10000c.in	1000c.in	100c.in		10c.in		20c.in		30000c.in	README-tests1
10000c.out	1000c.out	100c.out	10c.out		20c.out		30000c.out

The graphs are constructed in such a way that node 1 is the center, except for 20c.in.
Note that the the program for graph of size 30000 may run a few minutes, if it is not optimized. 

The edge weights (entries in the matrix)  are relatively samll.  To test how
your programs handle large numbers youmay want to change some weights.
